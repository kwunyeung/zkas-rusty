//! `ZKas-walletd` — a shielded wallet daemon for the ZKas network.
//!
//! It is the engine behind the ZKas web wallet. It drives the *same* shielded
//! primitives the CLI `shielded-pay` uses (`kaspa-shielded-core`): key generation,
//! chain scan with the wallet's viewing key, real Orchard (Halo 2) shielded spends,
//! and message sign/verify. Proofs are generated natively here (no in-browser Halo 2
//! needed) and submitted to a ZKas node over gRPC.
//!
//! ## Custody model
//!
//! The shipped product model is **non-custodial / watch-only**. The device keeps its
//! seed and registers only its 96-byte full viewing key (`/api/wallet/watch`); the
//! daemon scans the chain for it and builds Halo2 spend *proofs* (`/api/wallet/prepare`),
//! but never holds spend authority — the device signs each payment itself and hands
//! the signatures back via `/api/wallet/submit`. A daemon compromise then leaks
//! *visibility* into these wallets, never their coins.
//!
//! Custodial seed wallets (`create` / `import` / `send` / `send_many` / `reveal` /
//! `consolidate` / `sign`) remain supported for self-hosted and payment-gateway use,
//! where the operator IS the owner. On a hosted multi-tenant deployment they can be
//! switched off entirely with `--no-custodial`, which makes every seed-requiring
//! endpoint return 403.
//!
//! ## Two deployment modes
//!
//! - **Self-hosted:** the user runs this on their own machine (or on their node via
//!   `--serve-public`: built-in TLS + a bearer-token pairing QR). Point the web UI's
//!   daemon URL at `http://127.0.0.1:8501`.
//! - **Hosted (non-custodial):** one instance serves many browsers behind a reverse
//!   proxy, connected to a public ZKas node so users need no node of their own. Each
//!   browser owns a random **wallet token** (an `X-Wallet-Token` header); the daemon
//!   keeps one wallet per token, each holding only a viewing key. Do not expose this
//!   daemon directly; put a TLS proxy in front, keep the bind on loopback, and run
//!   with `--no-custodial` (see OPERATIONS.md).
//!
//! ## Sync model
//!
//! Each wallet keeps a live [`WalletDb`] in memory and advances it **incrementally**:
//! an initial one-time replay from genesis (needed to build the note-commitment tree
//! correctly), then cheap catch-up of only new blocks. The background loop processes
//! wallets in bounded chunks so status stays responsive while a big initial scan runs.

        // wallet. Users read that as the app contradicting itself, correctly, because it
        // was. The readiness a UI shows has to be the readiness the spend path enforces,
        // so it is published here rather than guessed there.
        // Deliberately NOT `tree_is_valid()`. A borrowing wallet clears that flag on
        // every appended leaf, so on a live chain it is false almost always — gating on
        // it would report a healthy wallet as permanently unable to spend. The mirror
        // tree is instead brought into line by `ensure_canonical_checkpoint`, which
        // waits for the shared tree rather than refusing. What remains, and what this
        // reports, is whether the scan is far enough along for a spend to be sound.
        //
        // Gated on reaching the ANCHOR, not the tip. A payment does not prove against the
        // chain head: it proves against a root `DEFAULT_ANCHOR_DEPTH + ANCHOR_SLACK`
        // blocks deep, and the spend tree is built only from blocks at or below that
        // cutoff. So a view that reaches the anchor already holds every note the payment
        // spends and every witness it needs; the blocks above the anchor contribute
        // nothing a proof consumes.
        //
        // Requiring `caught_up` conflated the two and cost real money-movement: a wallet
        // that hovers a few hundred blocks behind was refused although its proof would
        // verify — observed on a wallet holding 4.15M ZKAS, all of it matured, all of it
        // unspendable purely because a sync counter had not reached the tip.
        //
        // The allowance is DEFAULT_ANCHOR_DEPTH while the proof needs DEPTH + SLACK, so
        // ANCHOR_SLACK stays exactly what it is named: the cushion. It also absorbs the
        // small DAA-vs-blue-score divergence between `scanned` and the cutoff's units.
        //
        // What is genuinely given up is nullifier freshness: a note spent from another
        // device inside the lag window is unknown here, and such a spend is REJECTED by
        // consensus rather than mis-settled. Note that this risk is not created by
        // relaxing the gate — a wallet never ingests the last SYNC_TIP_MARGIN blocks at
        // all, so the blind window exists even when the app says "Ready". This widens it
        // from 200 blocks to 200 + lag; it does not open it. The UI is given
        // `blocks_behind` so it can say so instead of silently deciding for the user.
        //
        // The tree test is part of the predicate, not an afterthought: `/prepare` refuses
        // a wallet whose mirror tree is invalid unless it is BORROWING the shared tree
        // (which has no mirror of its own to check). Leaving it out here is how the app
        // came to show "Ready" and then answer a tap with "wallet is still catching up
        // with the shared chain state" — two flags, one wallet, seconds apart, and the
        // user correctly reading it as the app contradicting itself.
        //
        // Whatever the spend path enforces, this must state. If the two ever diverge
        // again, the card is lying rather than the daemon being strict.
        //
        // They did diverge, and this is the repair. The predicate used to add
        // `caught_up || scanned + DEFAULT_ANCHOR_DEPTH >= tip`, a test `/prepare` does
        // not make and `wallet_send` had already dropped because it "spuriously 409'd

        // 1.3 s while the screen still read "getting ready".

// This is the mobile / hardened path. The device holds the seed and never sends
// it: it posts only its 96-byte FULL VIEWING KEY to `/prepare`. The daemon scans
// watch-only, builds the Halo 2 proof, signs the throwaway padding dummies, and
// returns the payment sighash plus one spend randomizer (`alpha`) per real spend.
// The device signs each with `ask.randomize(alpha)` (e.g. via ZKas-signer) and
// posts the signatures to `/submit`, which applies them and broadcasts. A server
// compromise can see balances but CANNOT move funds — it never holds spend authority.
// The crypto split is proven in shielded-core (`non_custodial_payment_api_roundtrip`).
