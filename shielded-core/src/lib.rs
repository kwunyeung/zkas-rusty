//! ZKas shielded pool core.
//!
//! Wraps Zcash Orchard primitives (Halo 2, Pasta curves) to provide the
//! consensus-side shielded state described in `PLAN.md`:
//!
//! - the three-tier note-commitment tree (bundle -> chain-block -> global),
//!   whose global root is the **anchor** ([`tree`]);
//! - the nullifier set and its first-in-accepted-order conflict resolution
//!   (added in a later task);
//! - the turnstile supply invariant (added in a later task).
//!
//! The membership / tree logic sits behind the [`tree::NoteCommitmentTree`]
//! trait so the argument can later be swapped to FCMP++ / Curve Trees without
//! disturbing the consensus integration (PLAN §1, "Future direction").
//!
//! Crypto is **not** hand-rolled here: we reuse `orchard` and
//! `incrementalmerkletree` and will pin them to audited commits before launch
//! (PLAN §5, non-negotiable #4).

/// The Pasta curve implementation this crate's note arithmetic is defined over.
///
/// Re-exported so callers can name `pallas::Point` — e.g. to hand the scan path
/// ephemeral keys they already decompressed — without taking their own dependency
/// and risking a second, incompatible version of the curve in the tree.
