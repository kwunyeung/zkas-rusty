//! Wallet-side shielded transaction construction — the prover, the inverse of
//! [`crate::verify`] (PLAN §2.10 / §3 wallet).
//!
//! This is what *produces* a shielded transaction: it derives keys, builds an
//! Orchard bundle, creates the Halo 2 proof, and signs the binding + spend-auth
//! signatures over the ZKas sighash — emitting a [`ShieldedBundle`] in our
//! canonical wire format, ready to carry in a transaction payload and be
//! accepted by the consensus verifier.
//!
//! The whole module requires the `circuit` feature (proving needs the proving
//! key). Proving is the heavy operation; PLAN §2.10 anticipates GPU-assisted and
//! delegated proving for light wallets — by Orchard's key separation, a delegated
//! prover never gains spend authority. This module is the local-proving core.

/// Wallet scanning — the receive side (§2.10). Trial-decrypts a bundle's outputs
/// with an incoming viewing key to recover notes sent to the holder. Pure
/// decryption; no proving circuit required, so this is available without the
/// `circuit` feature. (Under mandatory privacy, everyone always scans — this is
/// the hot path a light-wallet indexer accelerates.)

    /// genuinely ours must show `0x02`. Everything that survives is handed to orchard's

    /// The correctness argument is therefore short: the filter's condition is implied
    /// by orchard's, so the set it passes through is a SUPERSET of orchard's. It cannot
    /// miss a note — the only failure that matters, since a missed note is a user's
    /// coins appearing to vanish. False positives cost nothing: orchard discards them,

    // the GPU path cost, against a 0.324 us kernel — 45% of the path was marshalling
    // around the part that had been moved. The comment above says "the device was
    // waiting on a for-loop"; this is the same observation one level up, and the loop
    // is now on the device.

    // secret: a verdict.
